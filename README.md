Secure Licensing System For User Management for C# and PHP

**Last updated on May 24 2017.**

### How to use
1. Please upload PHP files to your web server. Your server must support PHP 7.0 or above and MySQL(MariaDB) also.
2. After uploading all files, please create a new database in MySQL and query Table.sql to that database.
3. If finished, then please try to change these values for security to your own in here: "config/constant.php"
4. Set up your C# code. If you don't know how to, please read API Checker's code.

The server will return the status code of the string type. So you can use the switch method to control your program.


This is a free-to-use version of LeonaFX Licensing, which no longer maintained.
